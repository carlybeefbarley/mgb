Made first 4 mockups for header minigames, all should be playable with only touch/mouse.

If any of these mockups catch your eye then i will polish them more. If no i can make mockups for different games, i have a few more in my mind (one is target shooting, like in carneval tents where targets pop up and you shoot)

  1.jpg - Gameplay is that cube jumps from top to top of the white peaks, can collect cubes in air for points. the jump happens, platforms scroll to the right and then player can proceed to next jump. Platforms get in screen with a nice tween from bottom.

2. jpg - Eat a lot - the player taps meat piece and progress bar shows up and the goal is to eat as much as you can before bar runs out. similar to - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyno9KKyYC8

3. jpg - Red robot floats around the screen, fire coming from bottom and particles shooting around, can interact with chest/grass. when taps chest diamonds fall out and chest dissapears and another can pop in screen.

4. jpg - simple catapult game with physics.

Note, #2 looks most immediately intersting
