# /both/routes

In these routes files, there is typically a ReactLayout.render() call. The first parameter of this call is to specify the desired Layout.

These layouts are being defined in /client/components/layout/\*.jsx

The layout file initially being used is /client/components/layout/default.jsx and is stored in the global variable 'Default'
