Notes on use of Semantic UI React



<Popup>: 
For now, the element passed to trigger={} must meet some extra requirements:
  1. It must pass on unused props to children (e.g. using the spread
     props
  2. It can't be a pure-functional component. It has to be either
     a built-in component like "div", or a React component with backing 
     state (i.e. created by extending React.Component)
