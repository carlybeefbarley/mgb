<Popup>: 
For now, the element passed to trigger={} must meet some extra requirements:
  1. It must pass on unused props to children (e.g. using the spread
     props
  2. It can't be a pure-functional component. It has to be either

     state (i.e. created by extending React.Component or using the 
     React.createClass() method
