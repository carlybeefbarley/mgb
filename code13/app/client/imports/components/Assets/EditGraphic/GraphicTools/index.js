// We have attempted to put many of the drawing tools in a well-separated interface, 
// with the intent to one day let users write and plug-in their own drawing tools.

// Some tools are not so easily separated and it's more sensible at this stage to keep them in the main Code editor.

// Items of the form {label: STRING } represent the tools in the main edit codebase (CodeEdit.js).
