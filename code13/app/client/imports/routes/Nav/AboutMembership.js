    <p>
      MyGameBuilder has been 100% free during Public BETA with new users everyday with tens of thousands of
      assets created. We kept our site completely ad-free and will continue to do so. As we approach the end
      of Public BETA, we will transition into memberships for users to sustain MyGameBuilder. All users,
      current and new, will be allowed a 1-month free trial.
