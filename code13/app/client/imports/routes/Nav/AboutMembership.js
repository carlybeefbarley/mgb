    <p>
      My Game Builder has been 100% free during Public BETA with new users everyday and tens of thousands of
      assets created. We kept our site completely ad-free and will continue to do so. As we approach the end
      of Public BETA, we will transition into memberships for users in order to continue to maintain My Game
      Builder. All users, current and new, will be allowed a 1-month free trial.
