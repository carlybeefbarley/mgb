    // ludology.  Fancy word for the study of gameplay.  What's a game, what isn't?
    'what is game design?': C.E, // focus on what game design is and isn't.
    'backstory through gameplay': C.E, // in games avoid the WALL OF TEXT (or the dreaded cut-scene), players want exposition through gameplay not being told or shown.
    'setting versus mechanics': C.E, // explain the differences between the proverbial crunchy bits and fluffy bits.  Maybe 2 art assets, one for fluffy and one for crunchy.  Each would describe an event in their respective tones.
    'art or design': C.E, // where does the design of the fluffy bits leave the realm of the designer and enter the world of the art director?
    pacing: C.E, // what does the speed of a level tell you?  An action game might have a frentic pace, where a horror game might have a more measured pace.
    mood: C.E, // how can the puzzles and fluffy bits contribute to the mood of a game?
    agency: C.E, // what meaningful choices do your players think they have?  What choices do you want them to have?
    'the narrative': C.E, // does the game have a writer?  If so how does your design contribute to what (s)he has written?
    'the arc of action': C.E, // description of rising action from the inciting incident to the climax and finally to the resolution.  Game difficulty should roughly follow the same arc.
    'teach then use': C.E, // give a player a new ability, then give them a few places where they can practice that ability.
    'game design questions': {
      'is it fun': C.E, // prototyping helps find the fun faster!
      'is it interesting': C.E, // ??  I guess maybe you were thinking about fluffy bits.
      'is it challenging': C.E, // touch on balance and user experience.
      'is it social': C.E, // if your game is a multiplayer game, what social elements exist?

    gating: C.E, // keeping the player the right level for the challenges they face.
    scaling: C.E, // having the challenges increase in difficulty based upon player success.

      // specific examples of mechanics that illustrate different balance issues.
      'symmetric balance': {
        // games where each choice is functionally the same, although the fluffy bits may vary
        'rock-paper-scissors': C.E, // one of the most common mechanics in the world.  Symmetric because rock, paper, and scissors each have an equal effect (They beat 1 and lose to 1)
        'mirror match or mirrored maps': C.E, // nothing says symmetric balance like a perfect reflection of abilities and locales.  The deciding factor is the player's skill.
        // more to come
      },
      'asymmetric balance': {
        'unique Characters': C.E, // games like fighting games or mobas typically feature characters with different abilities
        'location bonuses': C.E, // maps that aren't mirrored give advantages, how do you balance that?
        'player skill': C.E, // balancing a powerful ability with a complex button combination or series of button presses.  The balance lies in the player's limitations.
        handicaps: C.E, // a way of offsetting differences in player skill by making the less skilled player's character more powerful so the end result is the players' characters are balanced.
        // more to come
      },
      'risk vs reward': {
        // discussion of how to use risk and reward mechanisims to motivate player behavior.
        'low hanging fruit': C.E, // easy objectives should be common to encourage the players
        'fortune favors the bold': C.E, // put valuable things in hard to reach, or dangerous places
        'skinner boxes': C.E, // what we can learn from rats pushing a button and farmville or cow clicker.
        // more to come
      },
      'other game mechanics': {
        'how many is too many': C.E, // different mechanics for different parts of a game are great, but how many is too many?
        'comprehensive list': {
          // a cheat sheet for mechanics, including short descriptions of ones we don't go into detail on.

        riddles: C.E, // A box without hinges key or a lid...

      // questions to ask when designing a level.
      'what does my level say?': C.E, // this is a bit esoteric, I may reword it.  Is it a long, open level or a clausterphobic tight puzzle?  What gameplay styles benefit from this level's design?  Which do poorly?
      'how does my level fit into the overall design': C.E, // does it fit in with the levels next to it?  Too many of the same puzzles / bosses / fights in a row?

      'how does my level into the difficulty arc of the game': C.E, // the game designer should have given you some indication of how 'hard' your level should be.  Is it harder than that?  Easier?

      'bottlenecks and chokepoints': C.E, // deliberate or accidental places where many actors try to move through or must move through.
