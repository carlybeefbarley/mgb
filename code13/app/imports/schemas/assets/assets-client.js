// Some client-side only utils for handling assets

/**
 * Simple helper to duplicate some nav-related info about an Asset.
 * The primary use case for this is how some pages that have an asset focus
 * (e.g. asset editors, play Game etc) will pass this info up to App.js so it
 * can be used to provide nav context in Breadcrumb bars, etc
 *
 * @param {object} asset
 * @param {string} assetVerb.. e.g 'View', 'Edit', 'Play' etc
