  deploymentVersion:      String,       // Of the format returned by mgbReleaseInfo.getCurrentReleaseVersionString(). Used to indicate when a deployment is rolling out.

  // Future examples of thing we will do with this:
  // safetyValveModeActive:  String,       // if null or undefined, then not in SafetyValve mode. If non-null, (including '') then the value is a human-readable string describing the safety valve reason (e.g. sudden user spike)
  // globalAssetLockActive:  String,       // Same as above, but for a global asset lock mode - for example found a corrupting bug
