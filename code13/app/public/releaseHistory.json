You can also drag an asset from a different MGB2 browser window - for example from the List Assets page. To edit your avatar, you just edit the graphic it uses. If you forget what this is, MGB can find it for you: click your avatar area when on your own Project Overview page: it will take you to the editor for that graphic asset.
