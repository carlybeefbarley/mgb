This is load testing service for MGB
Service has 2 parts:
1) LoadTestRunner (LoadTestRunner.js) - single page web app for controlling load tests and reporting test statuses
2) Slave Service (slave.js) - nodejs program - which will actually run tests (on phantomjs by default)
    and report back test results to LoadTestRunner (master)

Info:
* LoadTestRunner can spawn any number of slaves
    slave will create separate AWS EC2 instance and automatically connect to master
* Slaves has ability to self update - update occurs:
    * on first run
    * master can manually update all slaves

* Master and slaves communicate through websocket in JSON format (defalted over network)
* see slaveActions to see available commands on master
* see slave/slaveEvents to see which commands can be executed on slave
* To run test - LoadTestRunner will pick up first slave with less jobs running
