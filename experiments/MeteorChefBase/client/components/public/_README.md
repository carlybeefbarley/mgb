## Public (aka Unauthenticated)

These are the always-public (aka unauthenticated) components - for example the login page, signup page etc.


## React components

These are typically React .jsx files that define a component and reference a module to support it's functionality.


## They use code defined in Modules

The convention is for the module logic to be defined in /client/modules/*.js. They are exported via Modules.client
